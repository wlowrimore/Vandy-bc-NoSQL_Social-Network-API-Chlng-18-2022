# NoSQL Social Network API

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red)<br />

## Description

This is the back-end side of a Social Network Application. This application was created using MongoDB with its counter-part, Mongoose. With this application, the user is able to CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE information. This information includes: the USER, and that user's posted THOUGHTS, REACTIONS and FRIENDS. There also are "virtuals" and "getters" present, which provide "friend counts" and "reaction counts".
